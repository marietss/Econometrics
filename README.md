# Econometrics
In this folder I will post the exercises assigned during the graduate course in Econometrics at the University of East Anglia (UEA).
The lab part of the course (presented here) works with Rmarkdown in RStudio and how to "play" with data. \
I aim to post both the .Md and .Rmd files as well as the datasets (.r,.csv): anyone can strive to follow them and try on their own. \
Sometimes I contribute including additional codes than the assignement. \
A brief summary: \
Lab01 - Introduction to R/Rstudio. \
Lab02 - A brief and simple summary of Data Analysis. \
Lab03 - Simple Linear Regression. \
      - examples of Hypothesis Testing. \
Lab04 - Multiple Regression. \

Thank you to Prof. Michael Kummer (UEA) for the lecture notes and a special mention to M. Godinho de Matos (Católica Lisbon School of Business and Economics), R. Belo (Rotterdam School of Management of the Erasmus University) and  R. F. Reis (Católica Lisbon School of Business and Economics) for the labs material.
